## Introduction

My goals for this project are:

* to create a responsive website to showcase my knowledge of HTML and CSS. There will be 5 different sections, including the homepage, and additional subsections within those. I have developed this website with a 'mobile-first' mindset, and the website should be easily viewable on mobile devices but also change based on the viewers device size.
* to attract employers/recruiters of web developers and ensure my contact details and CV are available to them on the website.

As such, the intended viewer in my mind would be someone knowledgeable of sound web development practices and interested in employing a full-stack web developer.

## Sitemap

The viewer will start at a minimalistic home page featuring a greeting and a 'call to action' urging them to click around the site.

1. Home: As described above, with a footer showing my socials and a menu bar at the top.

2. About: Featuring my story and what I can bring to the table as a web developer. Also showing a picture of myself.

3. Projects: An area to display projects completed during my education as a web developer. In future I intend to make the project cards clickable and direct the user to specific pages relating to the project.

4. Blog: Here I will showcase my writings on technology, programming, web development, etc. Articles will include one image each with a heading and date of publishing.

5. Contact Page: This page will give the viewer access to numerous ways I can be contacted (Github, LinnkedIn, Phone, Email, etc). And will also include an input form to send a message straight from the page. This page will also feature a call to check out my downloadable CV.
